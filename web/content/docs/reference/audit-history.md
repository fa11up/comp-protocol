# Audit history

Every review the contracts have been through, in order, each linked to its job and its full record. Each round was pinned to one commit; its findings were fixed or answered in the commit after it, and the next round was pinned to that. Read top to bottom, the table is one chain from the first audit to today.

## How the reviews are run

The audits are jobs on the IdentityMD network, paid in IMD, and each is public on the [IMD explorer](https://explorer.imd.fun). Three kinds appear below:

- **Panel** (`template: audit`): four specialists read the same code at the same commit, one each for arithmetic, permissions, economics and control flow, and a judge merges their findings and re-runs every claim against the tree before it is kept. Most of the history is panels.
- **Adversarial review** (`adversarial-review`): one reviewer over the whole of the contracts, looking for what crosses subsystem lines.
- **Single audit** (`audit-imported-code`): one auditor over a stated scope, used for the first two rounds.

Two reviews were done in-house rather than by the network; they are marked as such.

Each record keeps the reviewer's or judge's summary verbatim, every finding with its reproduction, the raw submission beside it (with its sha256), and, for the later rounds, a resolution table saying how each finding was answered. A proof that came with a finding is kept as a regression test, so a fixed finding stays fixed.

## The chain

Severity counts (C/H/M/L/I) are critical, high, medium, low and info, as the round's judge or auditor kept them. "Answered in" is the commit that fixed, or accepted with a stated reason, every finding of that round.

## What the chain shows

- **No critical finding in any round. The final sweep of the whole system found nothing above low**, and the delta panel on its fixes found one medium in them, fixed with its proof kept. The highs were all fixed in the commit after the round that found them, each with its proof kept as a regression test.
- **The panels found their bugs in each round's newest code.** That is why the vault has had more rounds than the rest: its backing guard and its lagged capital were repaired through rounds 15 to 23, each repair audited again and each found wanting in the next round, until round 23's high was in the repair made for round 22. The lag was then replaced outright by three paced figures with a one-sentence guarantee (record 23); round 24 audited that and found no high, three mediums (an ordering gap, a wrongly stated condition, and a stale collateral term nobody but its owner could re-price), each fixed or restated in the commit after it.
- **Two items are accepted rather than fixed,** each with its reason in the code and in [Risks and open questions](../economics/risks-and-open-questions.md): a repayment one transaction before a redemption can lift what that redemption is paid, within a stated bound and only below par; and a redraw after a redemption releases a repayment's share of the fee base early. The rounds that tried to close the first did worse than the edge itself, and the records say how.
- **What the reviews do not cover** is in [Risks and open questions](../economics/risks-and-open-questions.md): the oracle service's signer, the fixed questions, and the economic assumptions behind the peg.

The raw record of every network job, and the full text of every finding, are in the repository's `docs/` folder.

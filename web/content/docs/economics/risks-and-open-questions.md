# Risks and open questions

The vault enforces its rules for collateral, prices and accounting. Those rules do not guarantee that imdUSD trades at $1, that the system stays solvent or that keepers show up. If backing falls below $1 per imdUSD, redemption pays less than $1.

## Prices and the oracle

**The price is signed by one key.** Each feed accepts a value only with a signature from the IdentityMD oracle service, for the feed's own question, from a panel at least as large as the feed's floor. The contract checks that signature. It cannot see the panel itself: it trusts the service's report of how many agents answered and agreed, and it cannot check that the agents worked independently or read the pool correctly.

**The second price is not independent.** The spot feed reads the same pool as the primary. It catches a bad or manipulated reading of that pool, not a pool that is itself mispriced.

**Large moves and stale feeds.** Within one feed lifetime, updates can move a feed only so far from where that period started, so a real, sudden move may be refused at first. Once a feed has been silent an hour past its maximum age, the allowed move doubles, and it keeps widening for every further hour of silence, so after a long enough gap the feed can follow any move. That recovery leans fully on the signer and the question, and whoever relays first after a silence sets the value the rest of that period is held around; the Treasury pays for an honest refresh once a feed's allowance has widened that far. A feed's very first value is bounded by nothing on chain, which is why the deployment checks the first values against the pool and an outside price before the vault exists.

**Someone with enough money can force liquidations at a false price.** The oracle reads one of IMD's trading pools. Pushing that pool down and holding it there for about seven hours (one feed window, plus the six-hour grace a marked position gets) makes the vault see a price lower than the real one. Any position below minCR at that false price can then be liquidated, and the liquidator is paid at the false price. In plain numbers: normally, someone who repays $100 of your debt takes $120 of your collateral. If the pool is held 20% below the real price, they take about $150 of your collateral at its real value, and every position under about 212% collateral ratio is exposed. Held 36% below (two of the feed's steps), they take about $188, and every position under about 266% is exposed. You keep whatever collateral is left. **What protects you is the grace period:** a marked position shows a warning on this site, and depositing collateral or repaying debt to get back above minCR before the grace period ends cancels the liquidation. Holding the pool down costs the attacker too: IMD also trades in other pools and on Base and Robinhood Chain, so for those seven hours anyone can buy IMD cheap in the held pool and sell it elsewhere, and the attacker must absorb every one of those trades. The deeper IMD's other markets, the more a hold costs. The protocol deliberately does not slow liquidations to stop this, because slower liquidations would let a real crash leave debt with nothing behind it, which costs every imdUSD holder. These liquidations do not touch imdUSD's backing, with one exception: a position so thin that at the false price it cannot cover the $120 for every $100 is liquidated down to nothing, and the small shortfall left over (about 9% of the debt of a position at 170%, after a 36% hold) is covered by the Treasury.

**A stale or disagreeing feed halts most actions.** Borrowing, withdrawing against debt, marking, liquidating and redeeming all wait for live prices. Depositing and repaying do not. The ETH/USD price comes from Chainlink, and if it goes stale, no IdentityMD update can fix it.

**Updates cost money.** The Treasury pays for price updates through `OracleAsker`, up to a daily budget that governance sets ([How updates are paid for](../reference/oracle-and-question-binding.md#how-updates-are-paid-for)). A request the feed refuses, or that ends without an answer, still costs its fee. A budget too small for a volatile market lets feeds go stale, which halts actions rather than mispricing them. Someone still has to call the asker, and relay gas is not reimbursed.

## Collateral and liquidity

**Seized collateral may not sell at the feed's price.** IMD trades in one concentrated pool. Thin liquidity, withdrawn liquidity, congestion or many liquidations at once can turn the liquidation bonus into a loss.

**Bad debt can happen.** A fast fall can leave a position owing more than its collateral. That shortfall is recorded. `cover` can cancel it with imdUSD the Treasury holds from fees; if the Treasury holds too little, the shortfall stays and lowers backing for every holder. There is no insurance fund.

**Backing per imdUSD is a cautious measure.** It counts only collateral that stands behind debt, and what a redemption is paid can rise by at most two points of par an hour however much capital arrives (the paced backing), so capital brought in just to redeem against cannot lift it faster than that; a real recovery reaches redeemers at the same rate. The figure falls at once and remembers a fall: a position that leaves the book in one transaction and returns in the next leaves it where the book stood without that position, which is below par only when the rest of the book carries an underwater position, uncovered bad debt or work-minted supply, and it climbs back at two points an hour. That never overpays a redeemer; it underpays them for those hours, and the operators keep it rare by liquidating and covering promptly. A position's collateral term is fixed at the price it was last touched at; anyone may re-price any position (`resecure`), and the keeper does after every price update. The price a redemption is paid at also falls at most 1% an hour (it rises at once), so a sudden fall in the attested price, whether real or a pool held down through the feed's window, reaches redemption payouts over the better part of a day rather than in one step: a 20% fall in about 22 paced hours. The rate bounds how fast a fall is paid, not how far: a pool held down is paid the hours it is held, so a profitable push has to be held against every arbitrageur trading it against IMD's other pools and chains, through most of a day rather than one feed window. The costs run the other way: after a real crash redeemers are paid at the higher figure until the paid price has followed it down, and a pool pushed up through one window underpays every redemption by the push, less 1% an hour, until it has decayed (about 18 hours for 20%). Neither takes anything: nobody is forced to redeem, and a redeemer's minimum lets them wait. It can fall after a redemption even when the system as a whole is better backed. A redemption can also fail if no eligible position can cover a reserve shortfall.

**Work-backed issuance is a limit at the moment of minting.** If minting from work is open, it is capped when imdUSD is minted. Later repayments, price falls or parameter changes can leave earlier work-minted imdUSD above the cap; nothing is burned to restore it.

## Governance and the Treasury

**Borrowing stops at the cap.** The vault lends at most 1,000,000 imdUSD in total (the debt ceiling). Once that much is borrowed, nobody can borrow more until borrowers repay or governance raises the cap, which takes a public proposal and a 48-hour waiting period. The site says so when it happens. Depositing, withdrawing spare collateral, repaying and redeeming keep working.

**One operator account governs**, a multisig wallet that needs two of its three signers. It proposes parameter changes, which wait out a fixed delay before anyone may apply them. There is no vote. A proposal never expires, so a matured proposal can be applied long after its date; watch pending proposals until they are applied or cancelled.

**Valid settings can still be bad settings.** Every parameter has hard limits written into the contracts, but a value inside those limits can still leave liquidation unattractive (the protocol's and marker's shares together may take the whole bonus) or overvalue a listed reserve asset.

**What the operator can and cannot take from the Treasury.** The operator cannot withdraw sIMD or any listed reserve asset; removing a reserve asset takes a delisting proposal and its delay. It may withdraw imdUSD only above what outstanding bad debt needs, and other unlisted tokens freely. A governed daily stream can pay imdUSD to a governed payee.

## Keepers

**No one is paid to keep watch.** Keepers need ETH for gas and imdUSD to burn, and they are paid only from liquidation bonuses. A mark earns nothing unless the position is liquidated. If liquidation is not profitable after gas, price impact and the protocol's share, positions may sit unsafe.

**Bundling gives atomicity, not priority.** `relayAndBite` makes an update and a liquidation succeed or fail together, but another keeper can still act first.

**An empty loan book is not proof of no positions.** A public node can return nothing for a range it declines to search. See [Reading state](../reference/reading-state.md).

## Smart-contract bugs

The contracts are immutable. A bug cannot be fixed with a parameter change; it needs a new deployment.

The code has been through thirty reviews since 2026-10-03: two single audits, panel audits of the vault, governance and the Treasury, and the price path (four specialists and a judge who re-runs every claim), adversarial reviews of the whole system, a gas review and four in-house reviews. Every finding was fixed, or accepted with its reason stated, in the commit after the round that found it, and the next round was pinned to that commit. A panel over the whole system found nothing above low. The vault's backing figure then went through two more panels: the first found the lagged-capital design's latest repair wanting and it was replaced outright by paced figures with a one-sentence guarantee; the second, on that redesign, found no high. A last sweep of the whole system found one high in a route no earlier round had priced, a pool held down through the feed's window inflating what a redemption is paid in IMD; the price a redemption is paid at is now paced. A panel on that fix showed the first rate (5% an hour) only delayed the hold by five hours, and the rate is now 1% an hour, with the panel's proofs kept; the same panel closed a block-boundary gap in the work ceiling's debt figure and added the health index to the launch check. A third sweep found the same root in liquidation: a pool held down through the grace lets a liquidator take more of a borrower's collateral than the bonus. That one is accepted rather than fixed, because slowing liquidations would leave real crashes to bad debt; it is explained above in plain numbers, and the site warns a borrower whose position is marked. The last review, a panel over every mechanism of the protocol, found no high: its one medium, a way to lock an honest price out of the oracle for two hours, is fixed with its proof kept. Two small changes since were reviewed in house: a fix that keeps the work oracle accepting new roots after a missed day, and the oracle purchases' failure callback. The full chain, with each job, commit and record, is in [Audit history](../reference/audit-history.md). Reviews and tests reduce risk; they do not prove every sequence of calls safe.

## Not yet proven

- That each launch feed accepts a live, service-signed answer to its own question. One attestation per feed is bought and its receipt published with the addresses at launch.
- How much IMD the pool can absorb under stress, and how many keepers will compete.
- Whether the oracle service answers fast enough for the maximum price age the feeds allow.
- That the daily update budget is enough in a volatile market.

# Redeem imdUSD

Redeem (`cash`) burns imdUSD from your wallet and pays you sIMD, staked IMD. It is the floor under the price: whenever imdUSD trades below what redemption pays, buying and redeeming is profitable. Unstake the sIMD in the staking vault to get IMD; sIMD received in a block cannot be unstaked in that same block, so do it in the next one.

## What you are paid

For each imdUSD burned, the vault pays sIMD worth $1, or the backing per imdUSD if that is lower, less the fee:

> sIMD out = imdUSD burned × min($1, backing per imdUSD) × (1 − fee) ÷ sIMD price in dollars

- **Backing per imdUSD** is the reserve plus the collateral standing behind debt, divided by imdUSD supply, never above $1. Read it with `backingPerUnit()`; the terminal shows it.
- **The fee** has a floor and a cap. It rises with the share of the fee base your burn represents (the warm imdUSD supply, never counted as less than 100,000) and falls back as time passes, halving every twelve hours. Quote it before you send with `redemptionFeeBps(amount)`.
- If backing is below $1, you are paid less than $1 per imdUSD. Redemption stays open, but it still needs live prices (fresh, and the main and spot prices agreeing), a valid candidate when the reserve is short, and a payout above zero.

### New capital counts gradually

Backing counts new collateral and new debt only as they age: what is still new halves every six hours and new capital left untouched for a day counts in full, while anything leaving counts at once. So someone cannot deposit and borrow, redeem at a better rate against that fresh capital and withdraw it again a few blocks later. Fresh debt and the imdUSD minted against it are left out together, so this mostly leaves your payout where it would be. The reserve counts toward the aged supply only in proportion, so you may see backing read lower for some hours right after a large new position opens, or after a sharp price fall.

## Who funds the payout

1. **The reserve first.** The vault pays from the Treasury's sIMD.
2. **A candidate position for any shortfall.** If the reserve cannot cover the whole payout, you must name a candidate: a borrower's address. The vault cancels that borrower's debt by the matching amount and pays the rest of your sIMD from their collateral.

A candidate must have debt, and its collateral ratio must be below `mat` plus the redemption spread `gap`. The Loan book's redeemable band shows such positions. The candidate must not end up worse off in ratio: the sIMD taken from them may not exceed their collateral in proportion to the debt cancelled.

## Prerequisites

- imdUSD in your wallet. No approval is needed: the vault burns it directly.
- Prices live: the price line on the Oracle tab must not say redeeming is paused (it offers **Update price** when it is).
- **Reserve on hand** on the Redemption tab, to see whether the reserve covers your amount. If not, a candidate address.

## Steps in the terminal

1. Open the Redemption desk tab.
2. Enter the imdUSD amount. Leave slippage at its default or set your own tolerance in basis points (1 basis point is 0.01%).
3. If the reserve is short, paste a candidate address.
4. Press Quote redemption. Read **You receive**, **Your fee**, **Served by**, **Debt cancelled** and **Minimum received**.
5. Press Review redemption and confirm. This sends `cash(amount, minGemOut, candidate)`.

`minGemOut` protects you: the call fails if the payout falls below it, for example because someone redeemed first and raised the fee. With no candidate, pass the zero address.

## What can block it

| Revert | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `ZeroAmount` | Amount is zero, or it rounds to zero sIMD out | Increase the amount |
| `StaleFeed`, `PriceDivergence`, `InvalidPrice` | Prices not usable | Wait for fresh, agreeing prices |
| `ExcessRepayment` | Amount exceeds total imdUSD supply, or the shortfall exceeds the candidate's debt | Reduce the amount |
| `MinimumOutNotMet` | Payout fell below `minGemOut` | Get a new quote; widen slippage |
| `IneligibleRedemptionPosition` | The candidate has no debt, is at or above `mat` plus `gap`, or none was given when needed | Choose another candidate from the redeemable band |
| `RedemptionWorsensRatio` | The sIMD taken would exceed the candidate's collateral share of the debt cancelled; common for a position that is already deeply short | Choose another candidate or a smaller amount |
| Token balance error | You hold less imdUSD than the amount | Reduce the amount |

A failed call changes nothing; your imdUSD is not burned.

## What your redemption changes

Your fee stays in the protocol as extra backing for the imdUSD that is left. A larger burn raises the fee for the next redeemer until it decays. Debt that was borrowed only recently and then cancelled by a redemption does not raise that fee, so a borrower cannot push it up cheaply. Backing per imdUSD can still dip after a redemption that cancels a candidate's debt, because that collateral stops counting as standing behind debt.

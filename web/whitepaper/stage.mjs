// Stages the INFER whitepaper for whitepaper.imdusd.com: the paper's own single file, unchanged, from
// its repository (fa11up/infer-whitepaper, checked out at ../../imd/whitepaper/web by default, or
// WHITEPAPER_SRC), plus the headers Cloudflare serves with it. Nothing else from that repository is
// uploaded: not its README, not its .git.
//
// No Content-Security-Policy, on purpose: the paper loads Google Fonts, reads DexScreener and
// api.imd.fun for live figures and frames giscus for comments, and a policy would have to be kept in
// step with a file this repository does not own. The paper renders with all of them blocked.

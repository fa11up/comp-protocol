// Genesis points. PURE: events in, points out; no network and no clock.
//
// One source for both consumers: the terminal imports this file through Vite, and the CLI runs it
// directly under Node's type stripping. Keep it to erasable TypeScript (types only: no enums,
// namespaces or parameter properties) so both can.
//
// THE RULE (user decisions, 2026-10-05):
//   1 point = 1 imdUSD held for 1 day.
//   - imdUSD in a wallet earns 1x.
//   - imdUSD provided as liquidity (imdUSD/USDC) earns a boosted rate: the launch has to solve
//     initial liquidity, so LPs earn more. Default 3x.
//   - Liquidators earn the debt they repay x a flat credit of 3 days.
//   - Borrowing and redeeming earn nothing by themselves: a borrower earns by holding or providing
//     liquidity with what they mint, and if they sell it the buyer earns instead.
//
// Points belong to an ADDRESS, not to the token. Whoever holds imdUSD earns from the block it
// arrives; the previous holder keeps what they earned and stops. Nothing transfers with the token.
//
// TIME IS MEASURED IN BLOCKS (a day is `blocksPerDay`, 7,200 on Ethereum at 12s). Every holder sees
// the same block count, so each share is exact; only the absolute figure moves with a missed slot.
// It needs no timestamps, so any RPC or explorer reproduces the same numbers. Within a block, only
// the balance at the end of the block counts: a flash loan earns nothing.
